	  	Pandas are endangered mainly due to habitat loss. Humans have cleared much of the bamboo forests that pandas need to survive. Besides bamboo, other types<br> of plants eaten by giant pandas include vines, grasses, green corn, flowers, and honey. Captive pandas are also fed foods such as apples and steamed corn bread<br>. Their population 	is low because humans used to hunt them and we destroyed their habitat to build roads and houses. The species also only evolved in certain parts<br> of China so there didn't exist that many in the first place.</p>

	  	The cuddly looking giant panda is the rarest and most endangered species of the bear family. ... These beautiful animals are among the world's most threatened species with only about 1,600 left in the wild. Giant pandas can't continue to survive in the wild without human protection. We should do everything we can to save the giant panda because we are the ones that have driven it to the edge of extinction. And because we can. But pandas also play a crucial role in China's bamboo forests by spreading seeds and helping the vegetation to grow. So by saving pandas, we will also be saving so much more. We will be helping to protect not only these unique forests but also the wealth of species that live in them, such as dwarf blue sheep and beautiful multi-coloured pheasants..</p>

	  	<p id="p6"> We love all animals equally but pandas are highly endangered as we cut the bamboo to make our own home's and furniture we ruin the Panda's home and we say that we love all the cute panda's but think about it how many panda's could you save if you had not bought that furniture made of bamboo. Now go think about what you have done and now help the panda's you must we wondering HOW?<a href="https://lp.panda.org/donate">By clicking on this on me you will be saving a panda wait a second I didn't mean panda I meant Panda's.</a>  So by protecting pandas, we‚Äôre helping to safeguard the broader environment, which so many people and animals depend on.

	  	<p id="p5"> Besides bamboo, other types of plants eaten by giant pandas include vines, grasses, green corn, flowers, and honey. Captive pandas are also fed foods such as apples and steamed corn bread.
Their population is low because humans used to hunt them and we destroyed their habitat to build roads and houses. The species also only evolved in certain parts of China so there didn't exist that many in the first place. Also, the species is more than 3 million years old so they can and have survived for a long time. But pandas also play a crucial role in China's bamboo forests by spreading seeds and helping the vegetation to grow. While the panda's future remains precarious, its numbers are slowly increasing in the wild.</p>

<H2 id="p4" style="color:#3966bd">üêºWhy are panda's important to the societyüêº</H2>
	  	<p id="p1"> Pandas themselves are also economically and culturally valuable. They are the national symbol of China and generate significant economic benefits for local communities through ecotourism and other activities. While the panda's future remains precarious, its numbers are slowly increasing in the wild. There are now more panda reserves than ever before and more projects to help people sustainably coexist with them. So by protecting pandas, we‚Äôre helping to safeguard the broader environment, which so many people and animals depend on.

<H2 id="p4" style="color:#3966bd">üêºSome for informationüêº</H2>
	<p id="p7"> Bamboo Propagation:
		<br>
Bamboo is the primary source of food for Panda's as it consists of 99% of their diet. When pandas eat bamboo, they play in a part in the propagation of bamboo. When giant pandas eat bamboo, they also eat the seeds which get distributed over a wide range of area due to their feces. Because of the feces, it makes for large bamboo distribution not to mention it plays a very big role in the propagation of bamboo. According to the WWF, increased bamboo production has decreased because of the decreasing amounts of giant pandas. If extinct, there would be no increased production not to mention that there would be little natural propagation.
<br>
<br>
Ecosystem Effects:
The natural habitat of the giant panda contributes to many advantages for the people of China. As the panda is now endangered, the Chinese people are reaping less benefits and with the consequence of extinction, the Chinese people would have no benefits. The habitat of the giant panda proves tourism capital, hydropower, agriculture, fisheries and water resources for the people of China. As pandas decrease, it deters the natural balance of the ecosystem with things like less bamboo distribution.
<br>
<br>
The Zoo Effect:
It is not a secret that the giant panda is found as a cute animal all over the world. Numerous tourists visit the zoo just to catch a glimpse of the beautiful animal which contributes in zoo attraction. Increased zoo attraction brings more people to understand the endangerment of pandas. Their attraction can possibly be a help when giving donations to panda preservation funds. Even though, this all seems attractive, there would be less giant pandas in the wild. If the panda were to be extinct, zoo attraction would decrease significantly not to mention that the panda preservation funds would be found useless.</p>

<H2 id="p4" style="color:#3966bd">üêºConclusionüêº</H2>
<p id="p8"> It may seem unthinkable that anyone would knowingly kill an endangered animal, but it does happen via illegal poaching. Panda skins and pelts can fetch poachers hefty sums of money on the black market. China has strict penalties for anyone caught poaching pandas, but some poachers persist, in spite of the risks. With wild panda numbers as low as they are, even a single panda killed by poachers is a devastating loss. While the struggle to preserve the much-loved bear has been an uphill battle for nearly 30 years, there has finally been empirical evidence documenting the progress of its remarkable recovery. As the public‚Äôs love for the species continues to grow, so will attempts to ensure its survival.</p>

<H2 id="p4" style="color:#3966bd">üêºFun Factsüêº</H2>
<p id="p9">
1. THEY HAVE GREAT CAMOUFLAGE FOR THEIR ENVIRONMENT
<br>
The giant panda's distinct black-and-white markings have two functions: camouflage and communication. Most of the panda - its face, neck, belly, rump - is white to help it hide in snowy habitats. The arms and legs are black, helping it to hide in shade.
<br>
<br>2. THEIR EYES ARE DIFFERENT TO NORMAL BEARS
<br>
Like domestic cats, giant pandas have vertical slits for pupils.
<br>
<br>
3.CUBS ARE WELL PROTECTED IN THEIR FIRST MONTH
<br>
Mother pandas keep contact with their cub nearly 100% of the time during their first month - with the cub resting on her front and remaining covered by her paw, arm or head.
<br>
<br>
4. COURAGEOUS CUBS!
<br>
At 5 months old, giant pandas learn how to climb - sometimes practicing by climbing on their mum.
<br>
<br>
5. A HELPING HAND
<br>
They have an extended wrist bone that they use like a thumb to help them grip food.
<br>
<br>
6. THEY SPEND A LOT OF THEIR DAY EATING
<br>
Giant pandas spend 10-16 hours a day feeding, mainly on bamboo.
<br>
<br>
7. BAMBOO IS CRITICAL TO THEIR DIET
<br>
Pandas need at least 2 different bamboo species in their range to avoid starvation
<br>
<rb>
8. BUT THEY DO OCCASIONALLY EAT SOMETHING OTHER THAN BAMBOO
<br>
Although pandas are 99% vegetarian their digestive system is typical of a carnivore. For the 1% of their diet that isn't bamboo, pandas eat eggs, small animals, carrion, and forage in farmland for pumpkin, kidney beans, wheat and domestic pig food.
<br>
<br>
9. PANDAS SOMETIMES DO HANDSTANDS WHEN THEY WEE!
<br>
Sometimes, to mark their scent, panda's climb a tree backwards with their hindfeet until they're in a full handstand upside down - enabling them to leave their scent higher up.
<br>
<br>
10.
 ENDANGERED!!

<br>
Giant pandas first became endangered in 1990 due to excessive poaching in the 80s and deforestation, depleting their bamboo food source. ... Since the 1940s, the Chinese government has worked to conserve giant panda habitat and protect the wildlife within it</p>
